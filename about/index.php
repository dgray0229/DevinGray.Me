        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Devin Michael Gray. I am an aspiring web designer and developer. This site is just a sample of my work and what I am learning on my journey. This is a portfolio of some of my designs, and an example of my coding skills. Everything on this site I have done 100% by myself, from the images, to the code behind this site. This site will undergo continual updates as I improve my skills as both a developer and designer. I have been working with code for awhile but this is my first official website. Thank you for visiting.</p>
