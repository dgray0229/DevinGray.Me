This is probably my favorite website to date. It was my first creation that I built from scratch. I learned how to create a responsive design and how to use floats. I learned the basics of how to create a slideshow, and how to use CSS transitions.

I created the lightbox display from scratch using jQuery. Creating image descriptions that toggle at the press of a button was an interesting success for me. It was all basic programming, but it was exciting for me.

This is where I first experimented with CSS Preprocessors. I didn't know how to install through the terminal at the time, so I had to use Codekit (which I would still recommend buying). Mixins and variables made my job so much easier.

I feel this project was the one that brought me the most joy, finally creating something that I could call mine, and I was so proud to show it to people, even though it was a far cry from landing me a job.
